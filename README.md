# Collaborative data aggregation and 3D visualization of digital twins
## 1. Introduction
We demonstrate how to build a functional digital twin that aggregates both geometric and non-geometric data from different sources into a high-fidelity 3D application. The workflow aims to address the challenge of 3D data interoperability especially with custom research tools, and additionally also allows researchers to engage deeper with the digital twin for enhanced insights. Researchers can further extend this application to build custom augmented interactive layers, add photorealistic physics, stream external data in real time and visualize their chosen virtual environment in VR. We use a sample dataset, with the ability for users to modify the workflow to leverage custom 3D datasets and use cases.​

## Prerequisites
* Have cloned the kit-app-template repository from GitHub.
* Downloaded the sample dataset to an adjacent directory.
* A development machine with an NVIDIA RTX GPU and latest drivers installed.
* Internet access and the ability to download the Omniverse Kit SDK and project files.
* Some background in Python and/or C++ is helpful.

## Core Outcome:
A high-fidelity 3D co-visualization of a custom 3D dataset augmented with non-geometric data streamed from an external source, with bidirectional connectivity between the two kinds of data.​
